#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were place in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product ='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customor account numbers for all the orders that were place in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
ON cust.order_id =FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. What products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St. Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, Sum(quantity)*price as revenue
From BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for thos customers
SELECT count(acctnum), avg(quantity*price) as Avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales As FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';
