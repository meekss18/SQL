# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the average danceability by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined the who Top 10 artist are by popularity.
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10 ;

#Next I determined what artist released the longeest song.
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc LIMIT 1;

#Then I determined the average danceability for the Top 10 popular songs.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10;

#Lastly I determined the average tempo and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(tempo),avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
